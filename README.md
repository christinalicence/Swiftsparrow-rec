 ## 1. User Experience

 ### 1.1 Purpose of the Website

 Swiftsparrow is a website for a recruitment business. I want people to be able to use the site to understand what we do and how to get in touch with us. The style should be simple to use and navigate, professional and friendly.

 The website is built using HTML 5, CSS3 and the Bootstrap library v5.3.

 ### 1.3 Wireframe Designs

 The wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). The design of the site has evolved since doing these, but these are the initial wireframes.

#### Contact Page

 ### Colour Palette used

The website uses a colour palette generated by [coloors.co](https://coolors.co/).

![Colour Palette of #246EB9,  #4CB944,  #FDFFFC, #F5EE9E, #F06543 ](assets/docs-images/swiftsparrow-palette.png)

 The primary colour is #246EB9
 The secondary colour is #4CB944
 The highlight colour is #F5EE9E
 The background colour-light is #FDFFFC
 The background color-dark is #F06543

I also used 2 other colours. I used #FCD4C5, a lighter pink, as a hover colour in the navbar, this is my secondary colour in the CSS variables. Using this colour helped me avoid contrast errors. I used #36454f, a dark grey,  as a colour for my text. It gave a softer appearance than black.

The colours were designed to be bright and standout, but still 'friendly' and easy to use.


### 1.4 Fonts 

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) were used. Open Sans is used for the majority of text. Montserrat is used for most of the headers. Raleway for some larger font sizes in headers. The back-up font is Sans-Serif.


## 2. Features

 The website should have the following features:
 
 - A home page with information about the company. This should include a recommendation quotes. It is built using Bootstrap grid system.
 - The purpose of this page is to give a user a visually appealing and simple introduction to the company.

 - A "Looking for a Job" page with clear information to help candidates understand the roles Swiftsparrow works on. This was built using Bootstrap grid system and cards for the job types.
 - The purpose of this feature is to allow users to get a greater depth of the work the company does 


 ![Image of mock up of looking for a job page](assets/docs-images/mock-up-jobs.jpg)



 - A "Contact Us" Page with a form that allows users to send information and their CV. The form was built using Bootstrap.
 - The purpose of this page is to allow people to contact the business and submit a CV if they want to.


![Image of mock up of contact page](assets/docs-images/mock-up-contact.jpg)



 - A "Thank you" page that appears when someone has submitted the form.
 - The purpose of this feature is so a user knows that they have successfully submitted the form


  ![Image of mock up of thank you page](assets/docs-images/mock-up-thank-you.jpg)



 - A "Data Policy" page that is mostly text and explains the company policy.
 - This is a legal requirement for a recruitment firm.


 ![Image of mock up of Data Policy page](assets/docs-images/data-policy-mock-up.jpg)



 - An error-404 page that appears when the server cannot access the specific page that a user has entered the url for. This page has a navbar to help guide the user back to the main site.

 - An easy to use navigation menu on all pages. This was built using Bootstrap and custom CSS.

## 3. Testing

Testing was carried out to ensure that all aspects of the website worked and had the highest accessibility possible.

### 3.1 Manual Testing

All links have been manually tested across the website. The contact form was also manually tested to ensure the inputs were working correctly.

I did manual testing to test reponsiveness using Google Dev Tools, an iphone 14 and a Google Pixel 8.

I also tested manually to ensure the Error 404 page was working.


### 3.2 Wave - Testing for Accessibility

I used the [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) Chrome extension tool to test contrast and other accessibility issues with the site. This was used throughout development to check - 

- All forms have associated labels or aria-labels so that this is read out on a screen reader to users who tab to form inputs
- Color contrasts meet a minimum ratio as specified in [WCAG 2.1 Contrast Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html)
- Heading levels are not missed or skipped to ensure the importance of content is relayed correctly to the end user
- All content is contained within landmarks to ensure ease of use for assistive technology, allowing the user to navigate by page regions
- All not textual content had alternative text or titles so descriptions are read out to screen readers
- HTML page lang attribute has been set
- Aria properties have been implemented correctly
- WCAG 2.1 Coding best practices being followed

I used it to test the Home page.

 ![Image of Wave summary showing contrast errors, minor alerts and website structure](assets/docs-images/wave-summary.jpg)

 It highlighted that the text in my footer and navbar were not sufficiently high contrast from the background - 

 ![Image of Wave report showing contrast errors on the navbar](assets/docs-images/navbar-contrast-test.jpg)

 To rectify this I adjusted the colours of the text and hover.

![Image of footer with lighter coloured text](assets/docs-images/adjusted-footer.jpg)

 It also highlighted that I had skipped a header level on my 'Get in Touch' page by using an h3 tag on my footer -

![Image of the h3 tagged header in my footer](assets/docs-images/footer-header.jpg)

I rectified this by changing the footer in all the headers to h2 and adjusting the styling in my CSS file.

It also picked up that the link to the data policy in the page didn't have enough detail -

![Image of data policy link error flagged](assets/docs-images/data-policy-link-error.jpg)

I corrected this on each page manually.

The Looking for a job page had a warning about 'redundant links'

![Image of redundant links warning on job cards](assets/docs-images/redundant-links-warning.jpg)

I chose not to change this as I wanted each of these links to lead to the contact form.

There were no other warnings/alerts on the site.

### 3.3 Lighthouse - Testing for Performance and Accessibility

I was aiming for 90% performance across the site using Lighthouse. 

The home page reached this standard -

![The Lighthouse report for the Home Page](assets/docs-images/lighthouse-home.jpg)

The Looking for a Job page performed well -

![Image of the Lighthouse report for the Looking for a job page](assets/docs-images/lighthouse-jobs.jpg)

The Contact page performed well -

![Image of the Lighthouse report for the contact page](assets/docs-images/lighthouse-contact.jpg)

The Data Policy page performed well -

![Image of the Lighthouse report for the data policy page](assets/docs-images/lighthouse-data.jpg)

### 3.4 CSS Validator

I used [W3 CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

It showed no errors -

![Image of no error report](assets/docs-images/css-test.jpg)


### 3.5 HTML Validator

I used [W3 HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

For the home page I got some INFO warnings about trailing slashes on void elements. This was because of the VS Code extension I used for formatting the code. I corrected these manually.

![INFO warnings on the CSS validator](assets/docs-images/html-val-home.jpg)

For the Looking for a Job page there were some HTML errors, I fixed these manually.

![HTML errors picked up by the validator](assets/docs-images/job-page-html-error.jpg)

There were no errors on the Get in Touch page or the Thank you page.

The Data Policy page had some errors from an incorrectly written email link. I corrected this manually.
