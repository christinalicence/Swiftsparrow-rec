 ## User Experience

 ### Purpose of the Website

 Swiftsparrow is a website for a recruitment business. I want people to be able to use the site to understand what we do and how to get in touch with us. The style should be simple to use and navigate, professional and friendly.

 ### Wireframe Designs

 ### Colour Pallette used

The website uses a colour palette generated by coolors.co
![Colour Palette of #246EB9,  #4CB944,  #FDFFFC, #F5EE9E, #F06543 ](docs-images.swiftsparrow-palette.png)

The colours were designed to be bright and standout, but still 'friendly' and easy to use.

### Fonts 

Google Fonts were used. Open Sans is used for the majority of text. Montserrat is used for most of the headers. Raleway for some larger font sizes in headers. The back-up font is Sans-Serif.

## Features

 The website should have the following features:
 - A home page with information about the company. This should include some reccomendation quotes.
 - A "Looking for a Job" page with clear information to help candidates understand the roles Swiftsparrow works on.
 - A "Contact Us" Page with a form that allows users to send information and their CV.
 - A "Thank you" page that appears when someone has submitted the form.
 - A "Data Policy" page that is mostly text and explains the company policy.
 - An easy to use navigation menu on all pages.
 - Visually pleasing footer on all pages with contact details and a link to the data policy.
 - The website should be fully responsive across different devices.
 - The website should have good accessibility, with alternative text for pictures, semantic HTML and adequate colour contrasts.

## Testing

### Manual Testing

All links have been manually tested across the website. The contact form was also manually tested to ensure the inputs were working correctly.

I also did manual testing to test reponsivenss using Google Dev Tools, an iphone 14 and a Google Pixel 8.
