 ## User Experience

 ### Purpose of the Website

 Swiftsparrow is a website for a recruitment business. I want people to be able to use the site to understand what we do and how to get in touch with us. The style should be simple to use and navigate, professional and friendly.

 ### Wireframe Designs

 The wirframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). The design of the site has evolved since doing these, but these are the initial wireframes.

 ### Colour Pallette used

The website uses a colour palette generated by [coloors.co](https://coolors.co/).
![Colour Palette of #246EB9,  #4CB944,  #FDFFFC, #F5EE9E, #F06543 ](assets/docs-images/swiftsparrow-palette.png)

 The primary colour is #246EB9
 The secondary colour is #4CB944
 The highlight colour is #F5EE9E
 The background colour-light is #FDFFFC
 The background color-dark is #F06543

The colours were designed to be bright and standout, but still 'friendly' and easy to use.


### Fonts 

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) were used. Open Sans is used for the majority of text. Montserrat is used for most of the headers. Raleway for some larger font sizes in headers. The back-up font is Sans-Serif.


## Features

 The website should have the following features:
 - A home page with information about the company. This should include some reccomendation quotes. This was built using Bootstrap grid system.
 - A "Looking for a Job" page with clear information to help candidates understand the roles Swiftsparrow works on. This was built using Bootstrap grid system and cards for the job types.
 - A "Contact Us" Page with a form that allows users to send information and their CV. The form was built using Bootstrap.
 - A "Thank you" page that appears when someone has submitted the form.
 - A "Data Policy" page that is mostly text and explains the company policy.
 - An easy to use navigation menu on all pages. This was built using Bootstrap and custom CSS.
 - Visually pleasing footer on all pages with contact details and a link to the data policy. This was built using Bootstrap and Custom CSS.
 - The website should be fully responsive across different devices.
 - The website should have good accessibility, with alternative text for pictures, semantic HTML and adequate colour contrasts.


## Testing

### Manual Testing

All links have been manually tested across the website. The contact form was also manually tested to ensure the inputs were working correctly.

I did manual testing to test reponsivenss using Google Dev Tools, an iphone 14 and a Google Pixel 8.

I also tested manually to ensure the Error 404 page was working.


### Wave - Testing for Accessibility

I used the [Wave] (https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) Chrome extension tool to test contrast and other accesibility issues with the site.

 ![Image of Wave summary showing contrast errors, minor alerts and website structure](assets/docs-images/wave-summary.jpg)

 It highlighted that the text in my footer and navbar were not sufficiently high contrast from the background - 

 ![Image of Wave report showing contrast errors on the navbar](assets/docs-images/navbar-contrast-test.jpg)

 To rectify this I adjusted the colours of the text and hover.

 It also highlighted that I had skipped a header level on my 'Get in Touch' page by using an h3 tag on my footer -

![Image of the h3 tagged header in my footer](assets/docs-images/footer-header.jpg)

I rectified this by changing the footer in all the headers to h2 and adjusting the styling in my CSS file.


### Lighthouse - Testing for Performance and Accessibility


### CSS Validator

I used [W3 CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

It showed no errors -
